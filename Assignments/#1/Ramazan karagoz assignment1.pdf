# Dataset

The dataset `eskisehir` contains the total population for the top-5 crowded
districts of Eskisehir in 2024.

```{r}
eskisehir <- data.frame(
  district   = c("Odunpazari", "Tepebasi", "Sivrihisar", "Cifteler", "Seyitgazi"),
  population = c(426581, 394734, 20258, 14814, 12878))
```

# Drawing a barplot

1. Please draw a boxplot to visualize the population of districts (20 pts).

```{r}
ggplot(data=eskisehir,aes(x=district,y=population)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

2. Please solve the problems in the plot to make it better (20 pts).

```{r}
ggplot(data=eskisehir,aes(x=district,y=population)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  labs(
    title="Population of the district in Eskisehir",
    x="",
    y="population"
  )
  
```

3. Then configure the plot to present it in a better way (40 pts).
You can use the tricks that you learned in the lecture.

```{r}
ggplot(data=eskisehir,aes(x=reorder(district,-population),y=population,fill=district)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  labs(
    title="Population of the district in Eskisehir",
    x="",
    y="population"
  )+
  theme_classic()+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::comma)
```

4. Interpret the plot (20 pts). It must be about the information of the 
district populations not the technical part of the plot.


According to the given chart, the first two most populous districts in Eskişehir are seen to be larger than the combined population of the other three districts. The population is concentrated between the first two districts.
