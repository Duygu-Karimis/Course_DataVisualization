# Project

## Topic

You must prepare a poster that tells a story about a problem or conveys a message through data storytelling.

## Evaluation

Posters will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Content and Communication (20 points)**  
2. **Use of Different Graphs (30 points)** (at least 3 or 4 suggested) 
3. **Appropriate Graph Selection and Necessary Adjustments (30 points)**  
4. **GitHub Repository Covering All Content Used in the Poster (20 points)**  

The repository should include:

* `README.md` (including visual outputs, the code used to create the graphics, and dataset source information)
* Plots (in PNG or PDF format)
* Code files (`.R` format)
* Dataset files (`.csv` format)

## Presentation

Project presentations are scheduled for **Friday, December 29, 2025, from 14:00 to 16:00** at the Faculty Foyer.  
All posters must be displayed on the boards in the area during this time. Preparation should be completed at least 15 minutes in advance.

## Poster Guidelines

* Posters must be prepared in **A1 vertical format**.
* Include your **name, institution, and email address** on the poster.
* The **dataset source must be clearly stated** in the text.
* Check the resolution of all graphics. Low-resolution graphics may reduce readability. Adjust titles, text, and aesthetics according to the text size on the poster.
* You can use tools such as **R Markdown, Quarto, Canva, PowerPoint**, or others to create your poster.
* For guidance on best practices, refer to the [BetterPoster method](https://github.com/GerkeLab/betterposter) and its templates.
